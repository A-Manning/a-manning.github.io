<p>In my previous blog post, I introduced the self-describing numbers, as well as some associated theorems and definitions.</p>
<p>In this blog post, Iâ€™ll show how the non-repeating self-describing numbers can be efficiently found. To the best of my knowledge, I am the first to find such an algorithm.</p>
<p>The first observation is that when a self-describing number is written as an n-tuple of pairs, any permutation of these pairs is also a self-describing number.</p>
<p>This implies that we need only generate the sorted n-tuples of pairs that form self-describing numbers, because we can then compute their permutations to get the self-describing numbers.</p>
<p>The second observation is that when a non-repeating self-describing number is written as an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple of pairs, the sum of the left elements of these pairs must be <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span>.</p>
<p>In combinatrics, a <em>partition of an integer</em> <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is a sorted n-tuple of positive integers such that the sum of the n-tuple is <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>As an example, the partitions of <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(4\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1,\ 3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(2,\ 2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1,\ 1,\ 2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>A partition of an integer <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> <em>with</em> <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> <em>parts</em> is a partition of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. For example, the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\((1,\ 1,\ 2)\)</span> is a partition of <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> parts.</p>
<p>When a non-repeating self-describing number in base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is written as an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple of pairs, the left elements of the pairs must be a permutation of a partition of <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> parts, and each part at most <span class="math inline">\(b-1\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can restrict our focus to computing only the possible partitions of <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> parts, and each part at most <span class="math inline">\(b-1\)</span>, since we can then compute their permutations in order to find all possible <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples that can occur as the left elements of pairs.</p>
<p>Consider the non-repeating self-describing numbers in base <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>. Any such number with <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> digits in base <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> will consist of <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> pairs, where the left elements of these pairs is a permutation of a partition of <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> with each part at most <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>.</p>
<p>The partitions of <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> parts are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1,\ 1,\ 4\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1,\ 2,\ 3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(2,\ 2,\ 2\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>When a non-repeating self-describing number in base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is written as an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple of pairs, if a digit <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> exists in the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple of left-elements of pairs with multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, then the left element of the pair with right element <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> must be <span class="math inline">\(m + 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>This means that we can exclude certain partitions. Returning to our example of the non-repeating self-describing numbers in base <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> digits, consider those numbers where the left elements of pairs are <span class="math inline">\(1,\ 1,\ 4\)</span>. Such a number must representable as a permutation of an n-tuple of the form <span class="math inline">\([(1,\ x),\ (1,\ y),\ (4,\ z)]\)</span>. Since the digit <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> occurs in the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple of left elements with multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, we know that the left element of the pair with right element <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> must be <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> does not occur in the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple of left elements, we can conclude that there is no non-repeating self-describing number in base <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> digits such that the left elements are a permutation of the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\(1,\ 1,\ 4\)</span>. Similarly, we can exclude the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\(2,\ 2,\ 2\)</span>, since the digit <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> occurs with multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, but the digit <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> does not occur.</p>
<p>How about the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\(1,\ 2,\ 3\)</span>? Consider the numbers represented as <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples of the form <span class="math inline">\([(1,\ x),\ (2,\ y),\ (3,\ z)]\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> all have multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in the left, we would require that the digit <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> occurs with multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> in the left. Therefore, we can exclude the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\(1,\ 2,\ 3\)</span>, and conclude that there are no non-repeating self-describing numbers in base <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> digits.</p>
<p>We can express the above observation more generally; When a non-repeating self-describing number in base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is written as an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple of pairs, if there are <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> digits in the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple of left-elements of pairs with multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, then the digit <span class="math inline">\(m + 1\)</span> must occur with multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider now the non-repeating self-describing numbers in base <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> digits. The partitions of <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> parts are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(1,\ 1,\ 1, 5\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1,\ 1,\ 2, 4\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1,\ 1,\ 3, 3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1,\ 2,\ 2, 3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(2,\ 2,\ 2, 2\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We can exclude partition 1 since the digit <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> occurs with multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> does not occur. We can exclude partition 2 since the digit <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> occurs with multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> does not occur. We can exclude partition 5 since the digit <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> occurs with multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> does not occur.</p>
<p>Considering partition <span class="title-ref">3</span>, note that this partition corresponds to numbers that are permutations of the form <span class="math inline">\([(3,\ 1),\ (3,\ 3),\ (1,\ x),\ (1, y)]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are neither <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. Indeed any permutation of this form is non-repeating self-describing in base <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>; Examples are <span class="math inline">\(31331219\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(17153133\)</span>.</p>
<p>Considering partition <span class="title-ref">4</span>, note that this partition corresponds to numbers that are permutations of the form <span class="math inline">\([(2,\ 1),\ (3,\ 2),\ (2,\ 3),\ (1, x)]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is neither <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. Any permutation of this form is non-repeating self-describing in base <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>; Examples are <span class="math inline">\(23211632\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(32142321\)</span>.</p>
<p>This strategy of computing non-repeating self-describing numbers in base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> digits by considering the partitions of <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> parts and each part less than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and then eliminating impossible partitions is remarkable effective. It is possible to express all of the non-repeating self-describing numbers in base <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> as permutations of particular forms, given only a pen and paper, and a few minutes.</p>
<p>In my next blog post, Iâ€™ll write a program that computes all non-repeating self-describing numbers in base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, based on the algorithm expressed above.</p>
